# Pachá — @pachamaltese

Hi, I'm Pachá — a senior developer doing my best to contribute to the R programming language by writing code that eases some of its statistical and graphical techniques for domain specialized and regional uses. I'm a huge nerd/geek, extremely concerned about reproducibility, I love Corto Maltese, Rick and Morty, Adventure Time, I try to read as much as I can, and I played rugby 🏉.
