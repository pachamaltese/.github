# Pach√° ‚Äî @pachamaltese

Hi, I'm Pach√° ‚Äî a senior developer doing my best to try to focus on my work. I'm a huge nerd/geek, extremely concerned about workflow reproducibility, I love Corto Maltese, Rick and Morty, Adventure Time, I try to read as much as I can, and I played rugby üèâ. I used to contribute a lot to the R programming language by writing code that eases some of its statistical and graphical techniques for domain specialized and regional uses, but these days I don't have much time for open source projects.
