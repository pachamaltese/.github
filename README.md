# Pach√° ‚Äî @pachamaltese

Hi, I'm Pach√° ‚Äî a senior developer doing my best to try to focus on my work. I'm a huge nerd/geek, extremely concerned about workflow reproducibility, I love Corto Maltese, Rick and Morty, Adventure Time, I try to read as much as I can, and I played rugby as right wing üèâ. I'm also a double certified Tidyverse and Shiny instructor by RStudio.

In my limited time I do my best to improve #rstats-based tools to facilitate open science and access to open data, but these days I don't have much time for open source projects.
