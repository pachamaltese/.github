# Pachá — @pachamaltese

Hi, I'm Pachá — a senior developer doing my best to try to focus on my work. I'm a huge nerd/geek, extremely concerned about workflow reproducibility, I love Corto Maltese, Rick and Morty, Adventure Time, I try to read as much as I can, and I played rugby 🏉. I used to improve #rstats-based tools to facilitate open science and access to open data, but these days I don't have much time for open source projects.
